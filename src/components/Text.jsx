          Most men procrastinate and feel depressed because they didn't figure
          out their purpose. <br />
          To figure out your purpose you need to have a system that will help
          you to think more deeply and ask things to come up with a plan. <br />{" "}
          These days our mind is so foggy and distracted that we can’t focus on
          one thing for a few minutes. <br /> Scrolling mindlessly on social
          media has conditioned our minds to become this dopamine-seeking
          machine that can’t do hard things that will not reward it with quick
          dopamine. <br /> Everything in life that is worthy requires hard work
          and dedication. <br /> Another very painful experience that is the
          reason for many men being repressed and feeling stuck is having these
          ideas or goals that they have in their mind and don’t know how to make
          it a reality they can’t even explain to someone what they want.
